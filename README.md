pic-dev
=======

This is my public repository for pic related development. That doesn't mean, of course, that the files in here have been written by me.

Directory PIC18F2550BB_USB_BASE contains the CDC demo for PIC2550 from dangerous prototypes. I made some small modifications so that's why they are in here. Else I would have just linked to the project itself.
Also, since I only use MPLAB-X I removed the "old" project files from MPLAB8 as with the path modifications I made I don't think they would work anymore anyways.

Directory Bootloader_Numato_PIC32MX contains a PIC32MX HID boot loader for the Numato PIC32MX development board featuring a PIC32MX795F512H.
