pic-dev
=======

This is my public repository for pic related development. That doesn't mean, of course, that the files in here have been written by me.

The only thing in here at the moment is the CDC demo for PIC2550 from dangerous prototypes. I made some small modifications so that's why they are in here. Else I would have just linked to the project itself.

Also, since I only use MPLAB-X I removed the "old" project files from MPLAB8 as with the path modifications I made I don't think they would work anymore anyways.
