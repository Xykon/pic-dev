pic-dev
=======

This is my public repository for pic related development. That doesn't mean, of course, that the files in here have been written by me.

Directory PIC18F2550BB_USB_BASE contains the CDC demo for PIC2550 from dangerous prototypes. I made some small modifications so that's why they are in here. Else I would have just linked to the project itself.
Also, since I only use MPLAB-X I removed the "old" project files from MPLAB8 as with the path modifications I made I don't think they would work any more anyway.

Directory cdc_basic_p24FJ256GB106 contains the basic CDC demo from the Microchip Libraries for Applications v2013_12_20 specifically adapted to run on the Dangerous Prototypes BusPirate v4 hardware.
